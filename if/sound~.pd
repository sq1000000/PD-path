#X text 300 200 "sound" maybe wasn't the best word I could have chosen
for this abstraction. there isn't really a word meaning "sound is present".
"loud" suggests there's a lot of sound;
#X text 200 100 this abstraction toggles on a box if the incoming audio
has any sound;
#X text 250 500 <- this box toggles if sound is found;
