This folder is full of abstractions that work as oneshot banks.

I've put all the oneshot abstractions in folders labeled with how many banks are available. So (for example) when you see a folder labeled '8banks', that means that the abstractions inside of that folder have 8 available sounds. If the abstraction doesn't have a folder that means that it only makes one sound, which can be triggered with an incoming bang.

Each oneshot abstraction is triggered by sending a bang to the first inlet. And the sound can be changed by sending a number to the second inlet.
