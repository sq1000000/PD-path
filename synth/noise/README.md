These abstractions simply jut output noise. Nothing more, nothing less.

Every abstraction that isn't put into a folder simply outputs one noise. These are often noise "colors". You can read more on the "colors" of noises [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise).

Every abstraction inside of a 'xbanks' folder has a number of available noises that can be chosen by inputting a number to their second inlet.
